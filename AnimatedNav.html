			<!-- The 'hash' (#) in an href attribute denotes a page fragment. #myfragment = fragment identifier that goes hand in hand with id="myfragment".
			When it is used by itself, it denotes an empty fragment, which is the page itself. It's the way many developers create anchors that don't link 
			to anything. In usability terms, it can cause a jump in the page (since it scrolls to the top of the document) and is actually discouraged. 
			Nowadays we see less of this sort of use since most pages are driven by some form of DOM script.The most typical use of this syntax is in example 
			code where there is no specific URL but the developer wants the tag to behave like a normal anchor element (so that pseudo selectors can be hooked).
			When we have events registered, we can remove the href attribute altogether, but leave the anchor tag and other attributes it may carry, such as title, 
			id, etc. The script can listen for events on these elements, without having to rely on HTML behavior (of a normal href link). CODECADEMY.COM-->
